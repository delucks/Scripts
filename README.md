# scripts

A bunch of one-off scripts, fun hacks, and stuff to make my window managers work.
All scripts in this repo are beerware and made by delucks unless otherwise stated.

## Python

* parse-last.py: Popen `last`, and parse the output into other machine and human readable formats
* sakai_util.py: Work with sakai sites (bulk upload/download resources)
* x86.py: Dump instruction information from the official Intel reference
* cdump.py: Dump pages of posts from craigslist so you can grep them
* linkvalidate.py: Print out the return codes of all the links on a certain HTTP site.
* charcount.py: Display count of each unique character in input
* imgur.py: Download an imgur album to a directory of your choice. Recently, added upload support
* roman.py: A python roman numeral translation engine. Wrote this to start learning Python.
* term_escapes.py: Import me and get some new colors!
* yearbook.py: a script I made before graduating college to download all of my alma mater's yearbooks

## Shell

* ansible-git-gen.sh: generates an ansible playbook which pulls every git repo in $HOME
