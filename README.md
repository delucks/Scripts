# scripts

A bunch of one-off scripts and ones vital to the operation of my custom desktop environment. All scripts in this repo are beerware and made by delucks unless otherwise stated.

## Python

* sakai_util.py: Work with sakai sites (bulk upload/download resources)
* ircbot.py: Learning project to create a bot that automates tasks I do in IRC
* Lsim.py: Encode/decode from the L-language used by Computational Theory (WIP)
* x86.py: Dump instruction information from the official Intel reference
* cdump.py: Dump pages of posts from craigslist so you can grep them
* linkvalidate.py: Print out the return codes of all the links on a certain HTTP site.
* charcount.py: Display count of each unique character in input
* imgur.py: Download an imgur album to a directory of your choice
* roman: A python roman numeral translation engine. Wrote this to start learning Python.
* res_sort.py: A python script to determine your wallpaper resolution and sort images based on it
* redditlinkdump.py: Take a wild guess
* term_escapes.py: Import me and get some new colors!

## Shell

* keycheck.sh: Check to see if a given RSA public key exists on servers in your ~/.ssh/config
* keyrotate.sh: Swap an old RSA key with a new key on all the servers in your ~/.ssh/config
* current: Notification script that gives current information about my system
* dmenu_ranger: Open a directory in ranger inside a new urxvt, cache it in case you're going to access it again

* block: Blurred screen locker
* spotifyctrl.sh: Mappings for the Spotify DBUS API
* digdug.sh: Draw a dig-dug dude in full color
* dvol: Super hacky volume control & notification script, integrated with Spotify
* jgit-3.5.sh: Not written by me (duh), a shell executable git binary. Good for those pesky servers which don't have git installed

## Other
