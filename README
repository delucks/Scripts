delucks' script repository!

All scripts made by me unless noted otherwise.
You're free to use my work, as long as you credit it.

Some standout bits from here:
	roman: A python roman numeral engine
	res_sort.py: A python script to determine your wallpaper resolution and sort images based on it
	dmenu_mpc_search: Control your mpd with dmenu!
